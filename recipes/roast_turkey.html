        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ground dried rosemary</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rubbed dried sage</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried thyme leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>1 (15 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
                <li>1 medium orange, cut into 8 wedges</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped into large pieces</li>
                <li>1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
                <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
                <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle champagne</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roaster with sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap around the turkey.</li>
                <li>Stir parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Rub the herb mixture into the turkey cavity, then stuff with orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery. Tie the turkey legs together with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body.</li>
                <li>Place the turkey on the foil in the roasting pan. Pour champagne and chicken broth over the turkey, making sure to get some liquid in the cavity.</li>
                <li>Bring aluminum foil up and over the top of the turkey and seal; try to keep the foil from touching the turkey.</li>
                <li>Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 2 Â½ to 3 hours. Uncover the turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 to 60 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
